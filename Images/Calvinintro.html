            <h1>Hobbies and Interest</h1>
            <Strong><small></small>Living in colorado I have alot of outdoor hobbies but I would have to say Sports is my #1!. I played football from the age of 8 and all through college. I also love to play Basketball and just about any other sport that comes up. Outside of spending time with my kids I enjoy fishing and going to the gym. A few years ago I went on my first Ice fishing trip and I have been hooked ever since.  </Strong>
